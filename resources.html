    <p>Over the course of my personal development, I occasionally stumble upon something that helps me get to another level. One of the best ways to repay the creators of that content is to share it with others who are on the same path as me. In this section of my website you will find various resources that I found to be truly helpful. Hopefully they help you as much as they helped me!<br><br></p>

          <h4><a href="http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-1/" target="blank">University of Helsinki - Programming With Java Course</a></h4>
        <p>
            Quite possibly the best resource I've used so far for learning Java. It's completely free and goes over almost everything you need to get started and the basics of Object Oriented Programming. There is a plugin for either Netbeans or IntelliJ IDEA which you use to check your code as you go through the exercises which is extremely handy. If you want to know more about this course, read my review <a href="https://paulmcaviney.ca/Course-Completed/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            This book is incredibly motivational. It is one of the most comprehensive sources I've found yet about building a personal brand and online prescence. I recommend the audiobook version because Gary Vaynerchuk just has a way of presenting that makse things stick a little better, also he jumps off script occasionally to add updated information or extra little tidbits about the current topic.
