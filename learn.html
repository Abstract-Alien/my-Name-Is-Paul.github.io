  <p>Welcome to my place of learning! As I learn new things that I think would be beneficial to share, this is where it's going to go.</p>

  <div class="container posts">
    <h1 class="text-center">Posts</h1>
    <ul class="blog-list">
      {% for post in site.posts %}
        <li class="well well-lg">
          <span class="post-title"><a href="{{post.url}}">{{post.title}}</span>
          {{ post.excerpt | remove: '<div class="blog-post">' }}
          </a>
        </li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
