        <br>
        <p>Front End Foundry is a brand new project I started and will eventually be my homebase of operations for Front End Development. I will be focusing on creating websites for clients and providing solutions to any front end issues they may have.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Beats4Freaks is a music blog website that I run. I update it three times a week with deadly electronic jams that I come across while looking for new music. Aside from music I also do monthly artist features and am planning on getting into interviews and other types of music news.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Hooked On Hiking is a website I started to provide someplace to write about one of my favorite past time activities. I plan on making it an excellent source for people to get information about hiking. I provide product reviews, features of great hiking and camping spots, and write articles specific to hiking.</p>

        <br>
        <p>This is the spot where I practice doing coding projects. At the moment I've only got my two freeCodeCamp projects and a custom navbar. Some things I plan on starting in the near future are pure CSS images and practicing animations. It will act as a mini portfolio that showcases my technical abilities.</p>
