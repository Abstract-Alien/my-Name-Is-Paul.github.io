<h1 class="text-center">Niche Down! - May 23 2018</h1>
<h5 class="text-center">Specialize And Be Better</h5>
</br>
<div class="post-text">

<p>
    Over the past couple of weeks I've been doing a lot of research on how to be a better programmer and entrepreneur in general. I watched countless Youtube videos, have been listening to audiobooks and reading a ton! Two Youtube personalities I've been paying the most attention to are: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jsonmez" target="_blank">John Sonmez</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyUBW72KU30dfAYWLVNZO8Q" target="_blank">Stefan Mischook</a>. Both are established developers and entrepreneurs, although from my understanding, John Sonmez is more of a lifestyle coach type deal now. Regardless, they both have quite a bit of useful information pertaining to programmers.
</p>

<p>
    One of the big takeaways I get from these two is I need to pick one thing and stick with it, at least until I become proficient. Hearing these two (among others) repeatedly state that I should learn one thing really well before moving on, really made me take a look at my own learning patterns. Previously, I would start learning something and, while still learning that thing, end up going down another path of trying to learn something else. This would continue on and on until eventually I would hardly even touch the first thing I was trying to learn. So with this new rule to go by, I'm sticking with Java until I'm a pro and then I will try to learn something else.  
</p>

<p>
    Before I get ahead of myself though, I should say that I've decided to specialize in Android Development. So when I say I want to be a pro with Java, I really mean coding in Java for Android. Since Kotlin has been announced to be officially supported by Android, I will probably take a crack at that later on. For now though, Java is enough of a handfull.
</p>

<h4 class="text-center">Why Specialize In Android?</h4>

<p>
    My reasoning behind specializing in Android can be boiled down to just a few points. First, the market is HUGE and isn't going anywhere. Second, I use and love my Android phone (Fuck Apple) and would love to contribute to such an awesome platform. Third, and arguably most importantly, apps can generate passive income. 
</p>

<p>
    With the Android market being so huge, there will likely always be a demand for developers. The Android ecosystem isn't just phones either. It includes TVs, vehicle consoles, refrigerators and home security systems, just to name a few things. So the opportunities for employment, should I choose to go down the employee route, are vast to say the least. 
</p>

<p>
    Contributing to Android would be a great feeling. Millions of people use Android devices everyday, and being able to make someone else's life a little easier with an app that I made myself would be on another level of awesome. 
</p>

<p>
    Having apps on the PlayStore generating me some sort of passive income is something that definitely interests me. In order to successfully label myself a Digital Nomad, I need to find some way to make money abroad, while I'm working directly on something or not. The user base behind Android phones is huge, thus opening up a massive group to market to. If I can build a bit of a presence online and direct people to my apps, I believe it could be a significant source of income, which leads me to my next topic..
</p>

<h4 class="text-center">Building A Presence</h4>

<p>
    The book <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Crushing-Great-Entrepreneurs-Business-Influence/dp/0062674676" target="_blank">Crushing It! By Gary Vaynerchuk</a> is something every wantrepreneur should read. I recommend the audiobook version though because Gary himself is reading it and goes off the script every once and awhile to provide more useful little snippets. The book made me realize that in today's digital age, it's impossible to be truly successful unless you build a personal brand. This resonated strongly with me because I want to make the entirety of my income from online sources, and how can I do that if nobody knows who I am or where to find my products? 
</p>

<p>
    This site is the first step to me building a presence online. It's a central source where users can find information about me, what I'm working on, things I'm learning and some of my past projects. I would love for it to be a great source of information for other programmers hoping to go down a similar path as well, hence the 'Learn' section. And who knows, maybe one day I can turn all that into some sort of course or eBook or something.
</p>

<p>
    The next thing I'm going to be looking at for building my presence is a Youtube channel. I've never posted a video online, and I'm kind of nervous about that, but I think it would be one of the most beneficial things I could do for my career. It will give people a direct look into who I am, unlike reading which is a little less encompassing. I will have a similar structure with my channel as I have with my site, which would include a Vlog spot and a Learning Area. I already have a few ideas for videos, I just need to sit down and so it!
</p>

<h4 class="text-center">Where I'm At And Where I'm Going</h4>

<p>
    I'm pretty happy with where I'm at on my path so far. I've finished the mooc.fi <a href="http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-1/" target="_blank">Programming With Java - Part 1</a> and am just about done Week 8 of Part 2. I haven't started making any of my own programs yet, but hopefully in the near future will be attempting that. I also found the Udacity course: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/new-android-fundamentals--ud851" target="_blank">Developing Android Apps</a> which I plan on taking after I finish the mooc.fi. It's a free course, and leads into the more advanced courses on Android Development. As a plus, the course is made by Google and you learn best practices right off the bat. The following courses (which cost money) also seem like they would be worth checking out. There's code feedback, actual app building you can add to your portfolio, and a strong community you are given access to. So as of the time of this writing, that is what's on my radar.
