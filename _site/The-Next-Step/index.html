<h1 class="text-center">The Next Step - April 19, 2018</h1>
</br>
<div class="post-text">
<p>So I've recently started listening to an audiobook called <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/No-Excuses-Self-Discipline-Brian-Tracy/dp/1593156324/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1524152773&sr=8-1&keywords=no+excuses+the+power+of+self-discipline" target ="_blank">'No Excuses! The Power of Self-Discipline'</a> and it's helped me realize that in order to attain my goal of becoming a software developer I need to focus everything I have to it. My main goal isn't exactly to become a software developer, it's to have the freedom to do what I want, when I want to; Work remotely, set my own schedule and only work on things that I deem worthy of my time. Software development is just one of the best paths which will help me attain this goal.
</p>

<p>It helps a lot that I actually am interested in programming, as I've tried persuing other areas of online income, only to realize it's extremely difficult if there's no passion behind it. Object Oriented Programming languages like Java just seem to make more sense to me and I am excited to reach a level where I can start making my own programs with it.
</p>

<p>Just because I'm dedicating the majority of my time to programming doesn't mean I want to give up everything else though. I still love art and self expression, so I will undoubtedly continue working on my artistic skills as well. I've recently started uploading some of my digital artworks to <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/my-Name-Is-Paul" target="_blank">redbubble</a> to try and make a little extra income that way as well. I can definitely see the potential to not only get my artwork seen by more eyes but also have another source of income, which in the end, will help me reach my main goal of complete independance. I'm interested in making a gallery section of my website where I can post some of my artwork, along with links to where a viewer can purchase some of them.
</p>

<p>So what is the next step? It's me doubling down. Focusing everything I have to achieve the life I want. The only person responsible for how my life turns out is me, and why the hell would I want anything less than the best? I want to be the very best I can be, and unless I take steps to get there, I will just slip through the cracks and be like everyone else: A mindless drone, living life on autopilot, content with mediocrity. I've written out 10 of my main goals and they are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Become Financially Independant</li>
  <li>Travel The World</li>
  <li>Be In Great Physical Shape</li>
  <li>Be In Great Shape Mentally</li>
  <li>Be My Own Boss</li>
  <li>Have Freedom To Do What I Want, When I Want</li>
  <li>Be Creative In All Aspects Of My Life</li>
  <li>Be A Part Of Something Beneficial To Humanity</li>
  <li>Make Something That People Love Or Say That It Is Their Favorite Thing In That Respect</li>
</ul>
Pretty lofty goals, I know, but I believe every single one of those is attainable. I just need to set realistic sub-goals and check them off one by one. In that respect, I've started writing out my daily goals the night before. This helps me ensure that I'm focusing mainly on things that will help me get to where I want to be. Streamline my focus.
</p>

<p>I'm enjoying the process, and I feel like updating this blog every once and awhile will help me stay focused. I'm gonna try to update at least onece a week, detailing the things I've been up to during the week and anything I've learned along the way. Once I have a clear understanding of certain technologies or things I can do with them, I want to dedicate an entire section of my site to fleshing that out, so anyone stumbling across my site might find answers on how to do something.
</p>

<p>In the meantime however, thanks for being a part of my journey to become a <del>superhuman/coding genius</del> productive member of society. I hope you find useful information in the following posts, and if you ever feel like contacting me, please don't be afraid to do so!
