<h1 class="text-center">Godot Or Go Home! - July 31, 2018</h1>
<h5 class="text-center">The Little Game Engine That Could</h5>
</br>
<div class="post-text">

<p>
    So I've been slowly plugging away at Udacity's Android Developer course series, and although I'm enjoying it, I'm not getting as much satisfaction as I was hoping to. I keep having visions of this grand video game that I've been wanting to build for awhile. I've even started working on it a bit! Game design is something I keep coming back to because it encompasses all three of my main passions: Art, Music and Coding. Put it all together and it is one of the best ways I can express myself. I've practiced with Unity quite a bit over the past couple years, and I wouldn't say I'm professional or anything, but I can make simple things. But if I want to truly make a name for myself, I don't think Unity is the right engine for that. Enter: Godot (pronounced gah-doh). It's a super lightweight game engine that can keep up with some of the heavy hitters.
</p>

<h4 class="text-center">Open Source</h4>
<p>
    One of my favorite things about Godot is that it is entirely open source. There is a strong developer community behind it, constantly improving it and making it a better contender with industry standards. It is licensed under the MIT license, which means that anything I make with it is completely my own. Any profits from a game I create go directly to me and my team should I choose to work with one. No need to pay for licensing or use the engine's splash screen at the begginning of the game (although I totally will with Godot becuase I love to support open source projects). I can also download the source code for the engine and modify it to my heart's content without worry of legal ramifications.
</p>

<h4 class="text-center">Excellent Workflow</h4>
<p>
    The layout of the Godot editor is something I really like as well. Everything about Godot speaks efficiency. From it's miniscule download size (about 40 mb) to its own scripting language. This engine is built for speed. I built the first little tutorial game in the documentation in a couple of hours. Although I will have to learn a new scripting language, GDScript isn't too much different than python, so it shouldn't be too difficult. 
</p>

<h4 class="text-center">Less Saturated Market</h4>
<p>
    One huge reason why I'm particularly interested in focusing on the Godot engine is the lack of learning materials. It's still a relatively newer engine compared to some of the others so that leaves a lot of room for newcomers to establish an authority on tutorials and demos. As I'm learning I can grow my Youtube channel into an excellent source for others to learn from. Already I've struggled so much trying to get some things done, I know it would be super beneficial to the Godot community. If I can eventually make a course series or something, it could be an excellent source of income, aside from games, if the value I provide is top notch.
</p>

<h4 class="text-center">Who Doesn't Love Video Games?</h4>
<p>
    I keep thinking to myself, there must be a reason why I keep coming back to video games. They are something I thoroughly enjoy playing and making them gives me instant gratification. Seeing the art I drew, music I composed and the code I wrote come alive is a feeling like no other, and the hurdles to jump over are challenging enough to keep me interested. So if there's anything that I would love to spend my time on, it would be making video games for people. I really hope one day I can make something and someone, somewhere will say "This is my favorite game!"
