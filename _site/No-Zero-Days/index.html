<p><br>An update about my progress with Java so far, my motivation for moving forward, and a couple new resources I've found.</p>
<!-- excerpt -->

</br>
<h1 class="text-center">No Zero Days - April 28, 2018</h1>
</br>
<div class="post-text">
<p>I know, I know, I said I was going to do a new post every seven days, but I've found with my work schedule it can be a bit difficult. My typical work day goes like this:
  <ul>
    <li> 3:45 A.M. - Wake up and get ready for work</li>
    <li> 4:30 A.M. - Get to site and 'start work'</li>
    <li> 7:00 A.M. - Actually start work</li>
    <li> 5:00 P.M. - Done work and back at camp</li>
    <li> 5:00 -> 6:00 P.M. - Hit the gym and get my pump on!</li>
    <li> 6:00 -> 6:30 P.M. - Supper time</li>
    <li> 6:30 -> 7:00 P.M. - Shower and clean up</li>
    <li> 7:00 -> Whenever I get too tired to do anything else (usually around 8ish) - Coding</li>
    <li> 9:00 P.M. - Throw on an audiobook and go to bed</li>
  </ul>
  As you can see, there isn't a whole lot of time to do anything if I want to invest a significant amount of my free time to learning Java or working on my game. I've been trying to implement my new mantra 'No Zero Days', so I try to get some coding in everyday, even if just for a little bit. The problem is, once I get started I feel like I'm not doing anything unless I put at least an hour in, and by the time that hour is up, I'm too tired to do anything else. 3:45 comes mighty early!
</p>

<p>TL;DR : Don't expect a new post every week, especially while I'm working. I want to spend more time being productive with what little spare time I have.
</p>

<p>All that aside though, I think I've been making decent progress. I'm about 1/4 the way through the Tim Buchalka Java course and I actually got the touch controls working how I want them to in my game. The Java course is starting to increase in difficulty, but it is still quite manageable, just have to use the ol' dusty computer upstairs (my brain) a little more. I also stumbled across another great resource for learning Java while browsing Reddit. It's called the <a href="http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-1/" target="_blank">Object-Oriented programming with Java, part I</a> put on by the University of Helsinki. It's completely free, and more similar to the freeCodeCamp learning path where you submit code and, using the plugin for IntelliJ, inspects your code and tells you if it passes. I like this way of learning significantly more because it gives you direct feedback if you are doing it properly or not. Not only that but I do believe you get a nice, fancy certificate at the end of it. (Not 100% sure on that last part but I will let you know once I'm done!)
</p>

<p>These last few shifts at work has made me realize how much I want to get out of the industry I'm in. I can't remember if I mentioned this before or not, but currently I am a third year electrician apprentice, specializing in overhead cranes. I've been working at Kearl Oilsands facility for the past three years and it's been slowly eroding my drive. The pace of work up here is extremely slow, and it can be hard to motivate myself to work somedays. I just need to feel like I'm actually contributing to something meaningful, and as of right now, I am not. I've been listening to podcasts and reading a lot online, and I've decided I want to be a digital nomad. I am 100% motivated to make this life change and start contributing to something useful, instead of being a part of an industry that is slowly killing the planet.
</p>

<p>The thing about working up here however, is that my schedule is the bee's knees. I work ten 12 hour shifts in a row and then get ten days off. Having those ten days off allows me to focus everything I have into learning the skills which will allow me to transfer fields. I figure, as long as I can get through the couple of course I'm taking, afterwards I can start freelancing while I'm still working. Finish my electrician apprenticeship (2 more years) and slowly build my client base before taking the plunge and travelling full time. I came across a great Reddit post yesterday (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/725nfh/so_you_want_to_be_a_digital_nomad/" target="_blank">Check it out!</a>) about what it actually takes to be a digital nomad. The author of the post gives a lot of great insight, mixed with some very hard truths that it's not as easy as all these e-books and podcasts say it is. What it boils down to is: Have a solid plan, build your business up <b><em>BEFORE</em></b> buying that plane ticket to Chang Mai. After reading it though, it only motivated me more to build up my skillset. <b>I NEED THIS</b>. If I don't try to build this life I want, I will regret it for the rest of my life.
</p>

<p>So on that note, I wanna share a couple of resources that I'm using to keep me motivated, help me learn and keep me on track. I'm going to eventually make an actual resources tab on my site here so anyone visiting can get a little direction if they want to follow a similar path.
  <ul>
    <li> Gary Vaynerchuk's book - <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Crushing-Great-Entrepreneurs-Business-Influence-/dp/0062674676?th=1&psc=1&source=googleshopping&locale=en-CA&tag=googcana-20&ref=pd_sl_6u87ie3l7e_e" target="_blank">Crushing It</a>. Just started listening to this one on audiobook, and it is pretty good for building a personal brand. If anyone can teach you how to do it, he can.</li>
    <li> Zack Burt's book - <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Software-Engineers-Guide-Freelance-Consulting/dp/1521163685" target="_blank">The Software Engineer's Guide to Freelance Consulting</a>. Just started reading this one as well, but it looks like it's going to be very useful in figuring out the freelancing world from a software engineer's perspective.</li>
    <li> Podcast - <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/software-engineering-radio-podcast-for-professional/id120906714?mt=2" target="_blank">Software Engineering Radio</a>. A podcast specifically about software technology which covers a very wide range of aspects.</li>
    <li> Podcast - <a href="https://cynicaldeveloper.com/" tartget="_blank">The Cynical Developer</a>. Another great podcast covering different aspects of coding technology.</li>
  </ul>
  That's a couple for now. Like I said, I will make a more fleshed out section of my website with specific resources and a lot more detailed. Maybe add a few affiliate links if I can, but I'm not gonna emphasize money making. I want to help people follow the same path.
</p>

<p>So that's it for now, I'm hoping my next post can be about my game I'm working on but I'm gonna need a bit of time to get everything I want to share in one place.
