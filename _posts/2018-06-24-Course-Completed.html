<p>
    It has been a little over a month since my last post, but there is a very good reason for that. I wanted to laser focus my brain to finish the Java course I was taking. If you haven't read any of my previous posts, The University of Helsinki put up a <a href="http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-1/" target="_blank">free online course</a> about programming with Java. It takes you through the basics of Object Oriented Programming with regards to Java, and then delves a little deeper into the Java architecture. Overall it is a great course and I highly recomend it if you are looking to get started with Java. I wrote another post about how to get started, you can read it <a href="https://paulmcaviney.ca/Get-Started-With-Java/" target="_blank">here</a>. Below, I will go into more detail about the course and hopefully I can give you an idea of what to expect.
</p>

<h4 class="text-center">Great Pacing</h4>
<p>
    One great thing about this course is the pacing. At no point did I ever feel like it was overwhelming. They do a great job slowly building up your skills to get you to a point where you can complete the more difficult challenges. I did every single one of the challenges in order and was never stuck on one for too long. If I did run into any trouble, the relevant information was just above to refresh my memory. Google and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> came in very handy throughout the course for anything I couldn't figure out just by re reading the material.
</p>

<h4 class="text-center">Excellent Challenges</h4>
<p>
    The challenges themselves were a great mix of easy enough to not get super frustrated, and hard enough to get a feeling of accomplishment as you progress. I really feel like I learned a ton through the challenges, and moving forward into Android Development, I will be able to retain a large majority of it because of them. One of the best parts about the course too is there is a code checking plugin for your IDE (either Netbeans or IntelliJ) which can tell you if you're on the right track with your code and give you instant feedback if it's done correctly or not. 
</p>

<h4 class="text-center">An Actual Certificate</h4>

<p>
    Another great aspect of this course is the fact you get an actual certificate at the end of both parts! Now, I'm not too sure how much it will help on your resume or not, but getting a real certificate for working through a challenging course is an amazing feeling. It helps reinforce that you are doing something worth while and learning an in demand skill. Not only that, you can print them off, frame them and show off to your friends! 
</p>

<h4 class="text-center">A Few Minor Dislikes</h4>
<p>
    Although this course is really great, and I do highly recommend it, there are a few things I didn't like about it. The first, and my biggest problem with the course, is the translation can sometimes be hard to follow. Since this course was created in Finnland, it had to be translated to English. Some of the wording becomes difficult to follow, especially near the end. This wouldn't be too big of an issue except it can be hard to determine sometimes exactly what they are asking in some of the challenges. It would have made life a little easier when the challenges were difficult and asking a lot towards the tail end of the course, if the wording was easier to understand.
</p>

<p>
    The only other problem I had with the course is, because it is a bit older, they were teaching some technology that has been deprecated. They use Swing for the User Interface aspect of the course, which is no longer the best way to do it. Although, it is still good to see how things were done previously, it would have been better to learn a technology that is more relevant Java fields today. I did read on Reddit that they were updating the course though, so that could be potentially fixed by the time you read this.
</p>

<h4 class="text-center">Conclusion</h4>
<p>
    Like I have already stated, I highly recommend this course if you are looking to get started with Java. It goes over everything you need to know as an introduction to Object Oriented Programming, and is great way to learn how to program in general. This isn't the be all end all of Java however. Like most beginner programming courses, it literally just scratches the surface and gives you enough to get started. Coding is an extremely vast landscape that can take a lifetime to traverse, but the Programming With Java course is an excellent place to start.
