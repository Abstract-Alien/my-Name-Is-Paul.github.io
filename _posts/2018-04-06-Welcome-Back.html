<h1 class="text-center">Welcome Back - April 6, 2018</h1>

<div class="post-text">
<p>I know it has been quite some time since my last post. I've been trying to figure out what exactly I want to do with my life and have been testing out a few different things. I found it was really hard to keep my motivation up when I was doing front end development so I decided to take a break. Since my last post, I started getting deeper into game development and was really enjoying myself. I made a few small android games by following various turorials and through it all I realized that I wasn't fed up with coding at all. Learning C# just made so much more sense to me than trying to figure out JavaScript!
 </p>

<p>Since I figured out that I still enjoy programming, I started researching a little more. It seems that Object Oriented Programming is right up my alley, so I decided to try and learn Java. I'm not very far into my first attempt (a pirated version of a Java Masterclass from Udemy) but so far I am really enjoying it! I am still working on games however, as I am quite fond of seeing something I made come to life, but I realize the chances of making a profession out of it are quite slim. Java is a hugely popular coding language and I don't see it going anywhere anytime soon so I figure it is a safe choice to try and get a career in, while still working on games on the side.</p>

<p>So as of now, I am going down the path of the java software developer. My end goal is to eventually work for myself either as a contractor or as freelancer. I am currently working on a mobile game that I'm pretty happy with and has potential (I will do a seperate post on that at a later date, with pictures!). The goal of my thirties is to completely shift my field of work into the digital realm. If I can get a couple games under my belt, I have a grand idea for a platformer that I would love to build. Goals and dreams! Just have to stay diligent and focused!</p>
