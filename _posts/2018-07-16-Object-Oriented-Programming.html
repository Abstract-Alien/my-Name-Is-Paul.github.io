            Although there are several paradigms a person can follow while coding software, arguably one of the most efficient models is Object Oriented Programming, or OOP for short. The basic premise of it is: instead of having a computer read the code from top to bottom, as in Procedural Programming, the code is made up of objects which follow a relational hierarchy. These objects inherit from classes that are defined with different types of data and specific logic on how to manipulate that data and interact with other objects.

            The concept of a class allows for other classes to use some of, or all of the original class' functionality. This is the definition of a common OOP term, inheritance. The parent, or super class, defines the data and methods to be used, while the inheriting class, or sub-class, determines how the methods are to be used. This effectively forces the programmer to put more thought into how these classes are to interact with each other, while keeping the code concise and to the point.
        </p>

            Another excellent aspect of OOP is the idea of abstraction. In coding, abstraction is the concept of hiding the code's complexity from the user. It allows the user to work with the code without having to understand everything else that is going on under the hood.
