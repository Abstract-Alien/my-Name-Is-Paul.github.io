        So I've decided to take up web development again. I know I've kind of been jumping around alot when it comes to learning things but this timeI think I can make it work. I know that I really do want to work in tech and I would like to do something somewhat visual, as I have an artistic background. I'm also really interested in web security, which is something I may persue down the line when I get some more experience. For now though I want to focus on web development. I tried it before and kind of gave up when I got the JavaScript portion of learning. This time around though I think I have an advantage because of all the other coding languages I've been dabbling in. The first time, JavaScript was the first actual coding language I tried to learn and wasn't exactly the easiest thing for me. So let's see how it goes this time! Anyway, I want to keep up with the blog again as a way to document my thoughts on my journey and have something to look back on down the road.

        Currently I am working down the path at <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">Free Code Camp</a> and I am enjoying getting back into that. I just finished the intro to HTML and CSS sections and am now working on the projects, starting with the tribute page. It's been good so far, but it's hard to rememeber everything I'm learning because I'm going through the challenges quickly. I think working on the projects is where I will solidify my learning. Also it will be nice to have a few projects I can link to through my portfolio.

        Let's hope it works this time around. I would really like to work in tech fulltime, preferrably remotely and now seems like the best time to get a remote position. Regardless though, I'm not going to put a lot of pressure on myself to learn at a specific rate or any hard deadlines for applying for jobs or anything. I want to take this easy and not burn out like I do with everything else. That being said though, the only other thing that I've dabbled in and am still actively pursuing is game development. I think I want to stick with that as well as more of a hobby with the intent of possibly releasing a game in the future while working on web development as my main career focus. And then in the future, start looking more into securing the web. It will be a lot easier to understand how to keep things safer when I know how it all gets put together.
