<p>One of the big things that propelled me down the path of the programmer was my desire to create a video game. After fiddling around with a couple of different programs for game creation, I fell in love with Unity. How streamlined everything is just made figuring out what the heck I'm doing fun! 
</p>

<p>So I followed some tutorials and courses and made a couple of simple games. One of the best courses I discovered (and have yet to finish) is Ben Tristam's Udemy course: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/" target="_blank">Complete C# Unity Developer 2D - Learn to Code Making Games</a>. After about one third the way through the course, I decided I would take a stab at making my own fully fleshed out game, available for download on the app store and everything. I was playing this excellent puzzle game called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kivano.marblemachine" target="_blank">Marble Machine</a> and thought it would be fun to try and recreate it with my own twist.</p>

<p>Everything started out just dandy. Things were going together nicely and all the C# I was writing somehow worked most of the time. I got a basic menu working with scrollable fields for world and level selecting. Drew up some assets and got a couple levels made. It wasn't until I was trying to figure out the proper touch controls, when I hit some roadblocks. To make each piece that is moveable able to be picked up and placed into a different cell, but only if there wasn't already something in there, took me forever! It was the longest I have ever been stumped on a coding problem. And let me tell you, once I figured it out I was exstatic!</p>

<p>That feeling of figuring something out after being stuck on it for so long is what propels me with coding, not just making games. When I get stumped on something I tell myself that getting past this hurdle will make me better. Proficiency isn't something that happens by accident!</p>

<p>So at the time of writing this, the thing I'm mainly stuck on is figuring out how to get the ball to boost nicely when it runs over a boosting arrow. I can get it to boost but it happens instantaneously instead of smoothly over time. It looks super cheesey and causes all sorts of problems if it hits the wrong spot. In the meantime I have been putting together other parts of the game, such as an instruction animation on the first level, and rounding out the colliders on the curved pieces.</p>
