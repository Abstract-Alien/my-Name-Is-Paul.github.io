<p><br>Welcome to my Blog! It has taken me a little while to get it up and running, as I have had to learn how to implement it properly with Jekyll. Actually, at the time of writing this, I still have to figure it out! It's coming along though, not super complicated.</p>

<p>So, how about a little more info about this website? This site is designed to be my personal portfolio. It will give potential clients and passersby a little insight into who I am and what I do. It's a place for me to post my projects and creations and with the blog it gives me a medium to express my thoughts and opinions.</p>

<p>Hopefully you will get some look into my personality by perusing this site (although nothing compares to a face to face). And if you like what you see or are looking for a quote for a website please feel free to email me! p.mcaviney33@gmail.com is where you can send it and I will reply as quickly as I can.</p>

<p>I am constantly learning new tricks, frameworks and languages. Of course practice is the best way to cement these lessons into my brain, and what better place to practice than my portfolio!? So be sure to check back to this site regularly, as I will be consistently updating and adding features as I learn.</p>
