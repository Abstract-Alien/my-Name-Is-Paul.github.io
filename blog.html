      <h1 class="text-center">My Journey As A Developer</h1>
      <p>In order to keep myself accountable, I've decided to include a blog section on my website. This will provide myself, as well as others some insight into the path I've taken and hopefully act as a resource to newer developers who are looking to take the same path. The posts contained within are about my own struggles as I learn, things that have helped me along the way and also just random thoughts about my journey into the (for me) unknown.</p>

      <div class="container posts">
        <h3 class="text-center">First Post / Temporary Placeholder</h3>
        <h5 class="text-center">June 18, 2017</h5>
        <p>This is my first post! It's a temporary one however until I can figure out markdown language and implement it into a more formal blog structure. This page here will be the main hub and offer snippets of each post.</p>
        <p>As of right now (June 18, 2017) I am running through freeCodeCamp, CodeAcademy, and a Udemy Web Development course to try and learn web development. I am about to learn gitHub as well. I want to contribute to open source projects as well as hopefully create my own. I will also try to put my website up and host it through gitHub because I read somewhere that if I use their static website generator 'Jekyll' I am able to do that, so we'll see!</p>
