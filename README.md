My portfolio website

I will continually update the readme as I make changes to my website.

This is my first attempt to upload my personal portfolio website and have it hosted through GitHub pages. I want to have everything I do 
to this site completely visible. Transparency will keep me accountable and if anyone checks out my code they can easily recommend changes.

  -Successfully uploaded files from my computer to GitHub. Next step is to figure out GitHub pages or some other free hosting service and 
  get the site actually up and running.

  -Everything is up and running properly, aside from a bit of the javascript code. But navigation all works how it should. Next up is to 
  try and implement an SSL certificate.
