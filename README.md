## My portfolio website

Welcome to the repository for my personal website! This site is meant to be a portfolio to demonstrate my skills in both software development and digital art. I'm hoping to turn it into an excellent resource for others to get information about various aspects of coding. I'm still on my path of learning, and hopefully I can help others on a similar path.
