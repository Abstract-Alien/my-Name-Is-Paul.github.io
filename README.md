My portfolio website

I will continually update the readme as I make changes to my website.

This is my first attempt to upload my personal portfolio website and have it hosted through GitHub pages. I want to have everything I do to this site completely visible. Transparency will keep me accountable and if anyone checks out my code they can easily recommend changes.
